Here‚Äôs the **answer key with explanations** for each correct answer in the CS75 Lecture 9: Scalability test:

---

## ‚úÖ **Answer Key with Explanations**

1. **C** ‚Äì *Shared hosting* places multiple customers on the same machine, which leads to performance degradation when one user consumes excessive resources.
2. **C** ‚Äì A *VPS* gives you your own OS environment on a shared physical machine, allowing more control and isolation.
3. **B** ‚Äì *EC2* allows dynamic provisioning and billing per usage minute, enabling you to scale up/down based on traffic.
4. **C** ‚Äì *Vertical scaling* means improving a single machine by upgrading its CPU, RAM, etc.
5. **B** ‚Äì You can only upgrade hardware so far; eventually, you hit limits in cost and capability.
6. **C** ‚Äì *Horizontal scaling* adds more servers, distributing load and reducing reliance on a single machine.
7. **B** ‚Äì A *load balancer* evenly distributes traffic across backend servers to optimize performance.
8. **C** ‚Äì *Round-robin DNS* does not account for server load, which can result in uneven traffic distribution.
9. **B** ‚Äì Due to *DNS caching*, users may repeatedly hit the same server, defeating load balancing.
10. **C** ‚Äì By storing a *server ID or session key* in a cookie, the user can be routed consistently to the same server.
11. **C** ‚Äì If session data is on one server, and the user is routed elsewhere, they may lose access to their session state.
12. **C** ‚Äì A *shared store* like Redis or a shared filesystem makes session data available to all servers.
13. **C** ‚Äì If the central session server fails, the entire session layer breaks, creating a single point of failure.
14. **B** ‚Äì *RAID* stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks ‚Äì used for performance and fault tolerance.
15. **C** ‚Äì *RAID 1* duplicates data to two disks, ensuring availability if one fails.
16. **C** ‚Äì *RAID 0* improves performance via striping but offers no redundancy ‚Äì one disk fails, data is lost.
17. **C** ‚Äì *RAID 6* can tolerate two drive failures thanks to double parity.
18. **B** ‚Äì In *master-slave replication*, slaves mirror the master, allowing *redundancy* and *read scaling*.
19. **B** ‚Äì *Master-master* allows bidirectional writes, so if one fails, the other can handle requests.
20. **B** ‚Äì *Reads* can be duplicated across many slaves easily; *writes* are trickier due to conflict resolution.
21. **C** ‚Äì *Partitioning* (sharding) splits the database across servers using a user attribute like ID range.
22. **B** ‚Äì Cross-server communication (e.g. messaging a user on another shard) requires complex syncing.
23. **C** ‚Äì *Memcached* stores key-value pairs in RAM for fast access, reducing DB load.
24. **C** ‚Äì *Least Recently Used (LRU)* eviction policy ensures old, unused entries are removed when full.
25. **B** ‚Äì *High availability* means system redundancy (e.g. failover mechanisms) to minimize downtime.
26. **B** ‚Äì In *active-passive*, one load balancer is on standby until the other fails.
27. **B** ‚Äì A long TTL means users may keep trying to access a failed data center due to outdated IP cache.
28. **C** ‚Äì Only HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) should be open externally for a typical web app.
29. **C** ‚Äì Exposing *MySQL* externally is a security risk ‚Äì attackers could attempt to query or inject.
30. **A** ‚Äì *SSL termination* at the load balancer centralizes certificate handling and reduces backend load.

## ðŸ§  *Latency vs. Throughput* â€“ System Design Test

---

**1. What is the difference between latency and throughput?**
A) Latency is the number of results per second; throughput is the time to get one result
B) Latency and throughput are always equal
C) Latency is measured in time; throughput is the number of results per unit time
D) Latency applies only to hardware; throughput applies only to software

---

**2. If a process has high latency but high throughput, what does that imply?**
A) Each task takes a long time and few results are produced
B) Tasks are completed quickly, but not many are processed
C) The system takes time to start, but once started, it processes many items quickly
D) The system completes each task instantly, but waits between batches

---

**3. In hardware design, why might latency be measured in clock cycles instead of time units like nanoseconds?**
A) Clock cycles are faster to measure
B) Clock cycles are easier to visualize than time
C) Hardware operates based on clock signals, making clock-period-based latency more meaningful
D) Nanoseconds canâ€™t be measured in digital systems

---

**4. What would be the throughput of a system that outputs 1 result every 4 clock cycles?**
A) 0.25 results per clock cycle
B) 4 results per clock cycle
C) 1 result per clock cycle
D) Cannot be determined without knowing clock speed

---

**5. If it takes 1000 ns to complete an operation on a 100 MHz system, what is the latency in clock cycles?**
A) 1
B) 10
C) 100
D) 1000

---

**6. Which unit would be appropriate for expressing throughput?**
A) Seconds
B) Clock periods
C) Results per second
D) Bytes

---

**7. Why do some tools report throughput in clock periods instead of standard units like results per second?**
A) Itâ€™s the correct way to represent throughput
B) It avoids floating-point numbers
C) It's a common shortcut for convenience, even though itâ€™s technically incorrect
D) Designers only care about time, not results

---

\*\*8. Which of the following best describes a scenario with **low latency** and **low throughput**?
A) It takes a long time to complete one task, but many tasks are done in parallel
B) Tasks are processed quickly, but very few are processed overall
C) Tasks are slow to start, but run rapidly afterward
D) Many results are processed in short bursts

## âœ… **Answer Key with Explanations**

1. **C** â€“ Latency is time per operation; throughput is operations per time unit.
2. **C** â€“ High latency means one task is slow, but high throughput means many tasks are still processed quickly once the pipeline is filled.
3. **C** â€“ Hardware is clock-driven, so latency in clock cycles is a practical metric.
4. **A** â€“ 1 result every 4 cycles = 0.25 results per clock cycle.
5. **C** â€“ 1000 ns Ã— 100 MHz = 100 clock periods.
6. **C** â€“ Throughput measures how many items (results, words, cars) are produced per second.
7. **C** â€“ Though technically incorrect, tools often simplify and express throughput as cycles between outputs.
8. **B** â€“ Low latency = quick response per task; low throughput = few tasks overall.

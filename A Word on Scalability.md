---

**3. In distributed systems, why might we add resources aside from performance?**
A) To make the UI faster

---

**5. What can happen to algorithms not designed for scale when load or data grows?**
A) They will adapt automatically
B) They become more efficient
C) Their cost may increase drastically
D) They reduce server utilization

---

**6. What challenge does heterogeneity introduce in scale-out systems?**
A) It forces all servers to be restarted frequently
B) It makes resource allocation faster
C) Some nodes outperform others, possibly breaking uniform algorithms
D) It eliminates the need for load balancing

---

**7. How should architects deal with the reality of heterogeneity?**
A) By avoiding hardware upgrades
B) By isolating old nodes
C) By designing algorithms that can adapt to node differences
D) By standardizing all machines to the slowest node

---

**8. According to the article, what is necessary to achieve good scalability?**
A) Wait until the system breaks before fixing
B) Rely on default settings and frameworks
C) Architect systems with growth, redundancy, and diversity in mind
D) Outsource traffic to third-party CDNs only

## ‚úÖ **Answer Key with Explanations**

1. **C** ‚Äì The phrase is used to critique systems whose architecture can't support increased load or size.
2. **D** ‚Äì Scalability is defined as performance increasing proportionally with added resources.
3. **C** ‚Äì Redundancy is added to improve *reliability*, not just performance.
4. **C** ‚Äì Scalability must be considered from the start, not as an afterthought.
5. **C** ‚Äì Algorithms not built for scale may ‚Äúexplode in cost‚Äù under larger workloads.
6. **C** ‚Äì Heterogeneous systems include nodes of varying power; uniform algorithms may fail or underutilize faster nodes.
7. **C** ‚Äì Adaptable algorithms can better utilize heterogeneous infrastructure.
8. **C** ‚Äì Proper architecture includes planning for growth, failure tolerance, and non-uniform infrastructure.
